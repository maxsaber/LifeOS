Deferred features and enhancements to revisit 


- [ ] **Multi-step reasoning** - Allow Claude to fetch additional context if initial retrieval is insufficient.
- [ ] **Proactive notifications** - Surface relevant info without being asked (e.g., meeting prep, relationship reminders).
- [ ] **Slack/Telegram interface** - Alternative to web UI for quick queries.
- [ ] **Time audit analysis** - Analyze Google Calendar to show where time actually goes vs stated priorities.
- [ ] **Connection discovery** - Find non-obvious relationships between notes, ideas, projects, and people using graph analysis.
- [ ] **Devil's advocate mode** - Given a position, construct strongest counterarguments informed by domain knowledge and user's specific context.

Also propose tags for confirmation - give me data I can return to you in CSV format. Do a once-over on everyone in the top four Dunbar circles, proposing tags for them from among a predefined list. For example, professional, personal, romantic, political, tech, mentor, mentee, as well as the cities they live in and states they live in, especially leveraging LinkedIn data.

There are a number of contacts from WhatsApp to our home phone numbers. Example 39da88c2-67da-4e05-be18-3cd3a405f1e5 with display name "+1∙∙∙∙∙∙∙∙90" - This is not good.I assume it's because these people are part of WhatsApp threads that have a lot of people in them, but I don't know them. Can we implement a change to the WhatsApp script so that it only actually includes interactions and entities from threads that have 8 or fewer people on them?
