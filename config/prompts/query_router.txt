## Routing Guidelines

1. **Choose the most specific source first.** If someone asks about a meeting, start with calendar. If they ask about an email, start with gmail.

2. **Add vault for context.** Most queries benefit from vault search since it contains synthesized knowledge and meeting notes.

3. **Use multiple sources when the query spans domains:**
   - "Prep me for meeting with [person]" → calendar + people + vault
   - "What did [person] say about [topic]" → gmail + vault
   - "What's the status of [project]" → vault + actions + drive

4. **People queries almost always need vault too** since meeting notes contain context about relationships and conversations.

5. **Text message/iMessage queries need people:**
   - "texts with", "messaged", "discussed with", "conversation with" → include people
   - Questions about what someone and I talked about → people + vault

6. **Person interaction queries need multiple sources:**
   - "interactions with [person]", "been in touch with", "relationship with" → people + gmail + calendar + vault + slack
   - When asking about a specific person's communications, search email, messages, AND Slack
   - Always include calendar to find meetings with that person

7. **Slack queries:**
   - "slack", "DM", "slacked", "on slack" → include slack
   - Work-related conversations often happen in Slack
   - Include slack when asking about coworker communications

8. **Time-sensitive queries need calendar:**
   - "tomorrow", "this week", "when is", "schedule" → include calendar

9. **Action/commitment queries:**
   - "what did I commit to", "action items", "todos", "follow up" → include actions
