# Google Sheets to Obsidian Sync Configuration
#
# This file defines which Google Sheets should be synced to your Obsidian vault.
# Sync runs nightly at 3 AM Eastern as part of the regular sync.
#
# Each sheet needs:
#   - sheet_id: The Google Sheet ID (from the URL)
#   - name: A friendly name for logging
#   - account: "personal" or "work" (which Google account has access)
#   - range: Sheet tab name (e.g., "Form Responses 1") or A1 notation
#
# To get the sheet_id from a Google Sheets URL:
#   https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/[SHEET_ID_HERE]/edit
#
# NOTE: After adding the spreadsheets.readonly scope, you'll need to
# re-authenticate by deleting config/token-personal.json and restarting.
